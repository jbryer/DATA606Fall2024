### Data Preparation

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load data from IPEDS.
library(ipeds)
library(psych)

data(surveys)
directory <- getIPEDSSurvey('HD', 2013)
admissions <- getIPEDSSurvey("IC", 2013)
retention <- getIPEDSSurvey("EFD", 2013)

# There are a lot of columns in these data frames. This will subset the data 
# frames to include only the variables we are interested in. We will also rename 
# the columns to be more descriptive.
directory <- directory[,c('unitid', 'instnm', 'sector', 'control')]

retention <- retention[,c('unitid', 'ret_pcf', 'ret_pcp')]
names(retention) <- c("unitid", "FullTimeRetentionRate", "PartTimeRetentionRate")

admissions <- admissions[,c('unitid', 'admcon1', 'admcon2', 'admcon7', 
		'applcn', 'admssn',	'enrlt', 'satnum', 'satpct', 'actnum', 'actpct', 
		'satvr25', 'satvr75', 'satmt25', 'satmt75', 'satwr25', 'satwr75', 
		'actcm25', 'actcm75')]
names(admissions) <- c("unitid", "UseHSGPA", "UseHSRank", 
		"UseAdmissionTestScores", "ApplicantsTotal", "AdmissionsTotal",  
		"EnrolledTotal", "NumSATScores", "PercentSATScores", "NumACTScores", 
		"PercentACTScores", "SATReading25", "SATReading75", "SATMath25", 
		"SATMath75", "SATWriting25", "SATWriting75", "ACTComposite25", 
		"ACTComposite75")

# Recode these variables to factors.
admissionsLabels <- c("Required", 
					  "Recommended", 
					  "Neither required nor recommended", 
					  "Do not know", 
					  "Not reported", 
					  "Not applicable")
admissions$UseHSGPA <- factor(admissions$UseHSGPA, 
						levels=c(1,2,3,4,-1,-2), 
						labels=admissionsLabels)
admissions$UseHSRank <- factor(admissions$UseHSRank, 
						levels=c(1,2,3,4,-1,-2), 
						labels=admissionsLabels)
admissions$UseAdmissionTestScores <- factor(admissions$UseAdmissionTestScores, 
						levels=c(1,2,3,4,-1,-2), 
						labels=admissionsLabels)

# Merge the three data frames to one using the unitid column 
# (unique identifier for the school).
ret <- merge(directory, admissions, by="unitid")
ret <- merge(ret, retention, by="unitid")

# Exclude schools that don't have one of these criteria.
ret <- ret[ret$UseAdmissionTestScores %in% 
		   	c('Required', 'Recommended', 'Neither required nor recommended'),] 

# IPEDS codes missing values as '.' which means R imports the data as 
# characters. This will convert those columns to numeric columns and any 
# instance of '.' will become NA (i.e. R's representation of a missing value).
ret$SATMath75 <- as.numeric(ret$SATMath75)
ret$SATMath25 <- as.numeric(ret$SATMath25)
ret$SATWriting75 <- as.numeric(ret$SATWriting75)
ret$SATWriting25 <- as.numeric(ret$SATWriting25)
ret$NumSATScores <- as.integer(ret$NumSATScores)

# Since IPEDS reports the 25th and 75th percentile, we will use the mean of 
# these two as a proxy of the median (i.e center of the distribution).
ret$SATMath <- (ret$SATMath75 + ret$SATMath25) / 2
ret$SATWriting <- (ret$SATWriting75 + ret$SATWriting25) / 2
ret$SATTotal <- ret$SATMath + ret$SATWriting

# Calculate acceptance rate. This is a proxy for selectivity of the school.
ret$AcceptanceTotal <- as.numeric(ret$AdmissionsTotal) / 
	as.numeric(ret$ApplicantsTotal)

# Drop any unused factor levels.
ret$UseAdmissionTestScores <- as.factor(
	as.character(ret$UseAdmissionTestScores))
```


### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

Are SAT scores predictive of first year retention?


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**

Each case represents a College or University in the united states. There `r nrow(ret)` observations in the given data set.


### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**

Data is collected by the [National Center for Educational Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov//) (NCES) as part of the [Integrated Postsecondary Data System](http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) (IPEDS). Data is submitted by Colleges and University annually.


### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an observational study.


### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

Data is collected by NCES and is available online here: http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/Home/UseTheData For this project, data was extracted using the `ipeds` R package.

### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The response variable is first year retention and is numerical.


### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The explanatory variable is median SAT score and is numerical.


### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

```{r}
describe(ret$SATTotal)
describe(ret$FullTimeRetentionRate)

table(ret$UseAdmissionTestScores, useNA='ifany')
prop.table(table(ret$UseAdmissionTestScores, useNA='ifany')) * 100

describeBy(ret$FullTimeRetentionRate, 
		   group = ret$UseAdmissionTestScores, mat=TRUE)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot(ret, aes(x=SATTotal)) + geom_histogram()
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot(ret, aes(x=FullTimeRetentionRate)) + geom_histogram()
```
