___ Overview ___
+ The data in this zip folder is more comphrensive than what is available in the OpenIntro R packages.
+ Most data sets are documented in one of the PDFs in the 'Guide' folder.
+ The code in 'conversionCode.R' was used to generate most of the text files from two OpenIntro R packages.
+ The 'ContingencyTableToDataFrame.R' code provides a function for converting a contingency table to a tab-delimited text file (includes an example).

___ Loading Data ___
+ Each data set can be read into R via read.delim() or read.csv(). (R is a free statistical software: r-project.org)
+ Other modern statistical softwares will be able to read in the data from the provided text files. If a CSV is required, an R function TabTextToCsv() has been provided in the 'TabTextToCsv.R' file that may be used to generate CSV files.
