# NYS Report Card

NYS publishes data for each school in the state. We will look at the grade 8 math scores for 2012 and 2013. 2013 was the first year the tests were aligned with the Common Core Standards. There was a lot of press about how the passing rates for most schools dropped. Two questions we wish to answer:

1. Did the passing rates drop in a predictable manner?
2. Were the drops different for charter and public schools?


``` r
load('../course_data/NYSReportCard-Grade7Math.Rda')
names(reportCard)
```

```

# Did the passing rates drop in a predictable manner?

Yes! Whether we log tranform the data or not, the correlations are statistically significant with regression models with `\(R^2\)` creater than 62%.

To answer the second question, whether the drops were different for public and charter schools, we'll look at the residuals.
