Define the explanatory variable as the independent variable (predictor), and the response variable as the dependent variable (predicted).\n* Plot the explanatory variable ($x$) on the x-axis and the response variable ($y$) on the y-axis, and fit a linear regression model\n`$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$`\nwhere $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, and $\\beta_1$ is the slope.\n    * Note that the point estimates (estimated from observed data) for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are $b_0$ and $b_1$, respectively.\n* When describing the association between two numerical variables, evaluate\n    * direction: positive ($x \\uparrow, y \\uparrow$), negative ($x \\downarrow, y \\uparrow$)\n    * form: linear or not\n    * strength: determined by the scatter around the underlying relationship\n* Define correlation as the \\emph{linear} association between two numerical variables.\n    * Note that a relationship that is nonlinear is simply called an association.\n* Note that correlation coefficient ($r$, also called Pearson's $r$) the following properties:\n    * the magnitude (absolute value) of the correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear association between two numerical variables\n    * the sign of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of association\n    * the correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1, inclusive, with -1 indicating perfect negative linear association, +1 indicating perfect positive linear association, and 0 indicating no \\emph{linear} relationship\n    * the correlation coefficient is unitless\n    * since the correlation coefficient is unitless, it is not affected by changes in the center or scale of either variable (such as unit conversions)\n    * the correlation of X with Y is the same as of Y with X \n    * the correlation coefficient is sensitive to outliers\n* Recall that correlation does not imply causation.\n* Define residual ($e$) as the difference between the observed ($y$) and predicted ($\\hat{y}$) values of the response variable.\n`$e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$`\n* Define the least squares line as the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, and list conditions necessary for fitting such line:\n\t1. linearity\n\t2. nearly normal residuals\n\t3. constant variability\n* Define an indicator variable as a binary explanatory variable (with two levels).\n* Calculate the estimate for the slope ($b_1$) as \n`$b_1 = R\\frac{s_y}{s_x}$`,\nwhere $r$ is the correlation coefficient, $s_y$ is the standard deviation of the response variable, and $s_x$ is the standard deviation of the explanatory variable.\n* Interpret the slope as \n    * \"For each unit increase in $x$, we would expect $y$ to increase/decrease on average by $|b_1|$ units\" when $x$ is numerical.\n    * \"The average increase/decrease in the response variable when between the baseline level and the other level of the explanatory variable is $|b_1|$.\" when $x$ is categorical.\n    * Note that whether the response variable increases or decreases is determined by the sign of $b_1$.\n* Note that the least squares line always passes through the average of the response and explanatory variables ($\\bar{x},\\bar{y}$).\n* Use the above property to calculate the estimate for the slope ($b_0$) as \n`$b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x}$`,\nwhere $b_1$ is the slope, $\\bar{y}$ is the average of the response variable, and $\\bar{x}$ is the average of explanatory variable.\n* Interpret the intercept as\n    * \"When $x = 0$, we would expect $y$ to equal, on average, $b_0$.\" when $x$ is numerical.\n    * \"The expected average value of the response variable for the reference level of the explanatory variable is $b_0$.\" when $x$ is categorical.\n* Predict the value of the response variable for a given value of the explanatory variable, $x^\\star$, by plugging in $x^\\star$ in the in the linear model:\n`$\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x^\\star$`\n    * Only predict for values of $x^\\star$ that are in the range of the observed data.\n    * Do not extrapolate beyond the range of the data, unless you are confident that the linear pattern continues.\n* Define $R^2$ as the percentage of the variability in the response variable explained by the the explanatory variable.\n    * For a good model, we would like this number to be as close to 100\\% as possible.\n    * This value is calculated as the square of the correlation coefficient, and is between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n* Define a leverage point as a point that lies away from the center of the data in the horizontal direction.\n* Define an influential point as a point that influences (changes) the slope of the regression line.\n    * This is usually a leverage point that is away from the trajectory of the rest of the data.\n* Do not remove outliers from an analysis without good reason.\n* Be cautious about using a categorical explanatory variable when one of the levels has very few observations, as these may act as influential points.\n* Determine whether an explanatory variable is a significant predictor for the response variable using the $t$-test and the associated p-value in the regression output.\n* Set the null hypothesis testing for the significance of the predictor as `$H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$`, and recognize that the standard software output yields the p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis.\n    * Note that $\\beta_1 = 0$ means the regression line is horizontal, hence suggesting that there is no relationship between the explanatory and the response variables.\n* Calculate the T score for the hypothesis test as\n`$T_{df}=\\frac { b_{ 1 }-{ null\\quad value } }{ SE_{ b_{ 1 } } }$`\nwith $df = n - 2$.\n    * Note that the T score has $n - 2$ degrees of freedom since we lose one degree of freedom for each parameter we estimate, and in this case we estimate the intercept and the slope.\n* Note that a hypothesis test for the intercept is often irrelevant since it's usually out of the range of the data, and hence it is usually an extrapolation.\n* Calculate a confidence interval for the slope as\n`$b_1 \\pm t^\\star_{df} SE_{b_1}$`\nwhere $df = n - 2$ and `$t^\\star_{df}$` is the critical score associated with the given confidence level at the desired degrees of freedom.\n    * Note that the standard error of the slope estimate `$SE_{b_1}$` can be found on the regression output.\n\n\n### Supplemental Readings\n\n* [OpenIntro Statistics slides](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2020/blob/master/Slides/OpenIntro/chp8.pdf)\n\n* [Interaction
