Graded assignments should use the provided R markdown templates provided below. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/tree/master/course_data/os3_data). Or alternatively all the data is included in the `openintro` R packge (use the `data(package = 'openintro')` command to list all the datasets available in that package). Right click on the \"Template\" link and choose \"Save link as...\" to save the R markdown file to your computer. By default, the Rmarkdown files should generate PDFs. This is the preferred format since PDFs can be uploaded to Blackboard. See the [software](/course-overview/software.html) course page for instructions on installing LaTeX.\n\n* [Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework1.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework1.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 2 - Summarizing Data](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework2.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework2.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 3 - Probability](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework3.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework3.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 4 - Distributions of Random Variables](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework4.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework4.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 5 - Foundations for Inference](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework5.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework5.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 6 - Inference for Categorical Data](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework6.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework6.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 7 - Inference for Numerical Data](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework7.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework7.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 8 - Introduction to Linear Regression](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework8.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework8.Rmd))\n* [Chapter 9 - Multiple and Logistic Regression](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/blob/master/Homework/Homework9.pdf) ([Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2024/master/Homework/Homework9.Rmd))\n\n",
