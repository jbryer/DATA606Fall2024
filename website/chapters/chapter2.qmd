### Learning Outcomes

* Use appropriate visualizations for different types of data (e.g. histogram, barplot, scatterplot, boxplot, etc.).
* Use different measures of center and spread and be able to describe the robustness of different statistics.
* Describe the shape of distributions vis-a-vis histograms and boxplots.
* Create and intepret contingency and frequency tables (one- and two-way tables).


### Supplemental Readings

* [OpenIntro Statistics slides](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2020/blob/master/Slides/OpenIntro/chp2.pdf)
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) - `ggplot2` is an R package by Wickham that implements the [grammer of graphics](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) (Wilkinson, 2005) in R. I will frequently make use of the graphing framework throughout the course and is worth learning.
* [Visualizing Likert Data](https://github.com/jbryer/likert) - An R package for visualizing [Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) data built on the `ggplot2` framework.
* [Quick-R base graphics](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/index.html) - Covers many of the visualizations using R's base graphics.

### Note about Pie Charts

There is only one pie chart in *OpenIntro Statistics* (Diez, Barr, & ??etinkaya-Rundel, 2015, p. 48). Consider the following three pie charts that represent the preference of five different colors. Is there a difference between the three pie charts? This is probably a difficult to answer.

However, consider the bar plot below. Here, we cleary see there is a difference between the ratio of the three colors. As John Tukey famously said:

> There is no data that can be displayed in a pie chart that cannot better be displayed in some other type of chart
