Navarro, D. (2018, version 0.6). *Learning Statistics with R*

> This is free textbook that supplements a lot of the material covered in Diez and Barr. We will use the chapter on Bayesian analysis. You can download a [PDF version](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2020/blob/master/Textbook/lsr-0.6.pdf?raw=true), [Bookdown version](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/), or visit the author's website at [learningstatisticswithr.com](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/).

#### Recommended

[OpenStax.org](https://openstax.org/) is a great resource for free textbooks. The following books will be helpful to have as a reference and to supplement, and get an alternative explanition, for many of the topics covered in this course:

* [Statstics](https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics)
* [Calculus](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1) - We will very briefly explain the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals that underlie some important statistical concepts. This books will provide much more detail.
* [College Algebra](https://openstax.org/details/books/college-algebra) - For those who need a refresher in algebra, this is a good resource.
