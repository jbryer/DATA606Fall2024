Welcome to DATA606! Your instructors will be Dr. Jason Bryer, Dr. Angela Lui and Dr. George Hagstrom. Couple of important notes as you get started:

* The course syllabus located on this website here: [https://`r tolower(semester)``r year`.data606.net/course/syllabus.html](https://`r tolower(semester)``r year`.data606.net/course/syllabus.html) We will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments. Please read the syllabus carefully! Send us any questions you may still have about the course.

* Complete this [Google Form](`r formative_assessment`) as soon as possible. We will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.

* [Join the Slack channel by clicking here](`r slack_invite_link`) (or use your @sps.cuny.edu email address). This will be our primary mode of communication. 

* For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email us at [jason.bryer@cuny.edu, angela.lui@cuny.edu, and george.hagstrom@cuny.edu](mailto:jason.bryer@cuny.edu,angela.lui,george.hagstrom@cuny.edu@cuny.edu?subject=DATA606).

* Complete the self-regulated learning assessment in DAACS. Visit [/assignments/daacs.html](/assignments/daacs.html) for more information.

* Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R. See the software page for more information about the software we will use for this course.

* The best way to reach us is on Slack. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a Zoom session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.

* Our Meetups will be on Wednesdays from 8:00pm to 9:00pm. **We expect everyone to attend or watch the Meetups.** Important information will be shared during the meetups that will not be available in any other format.

We am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!
